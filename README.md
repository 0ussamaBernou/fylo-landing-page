# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## How It's Made:

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

Used flexbox for the footer columns, but that didn't work well, so i used grid templates instead as i needed a specific number of columns to fit the entire width of the page.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned to make a floating section between two sections.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
